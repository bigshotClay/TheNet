# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records for TheNet project. ADRs document important architectural decisions, their context, and consequences.

## üìù ADR Template

Use this template for new ADRs:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-YYYY]

## Context
[What is the issue motivating this decision or change?]

## Decision
[What is the change we're proposing or have agreed to implement?]

## Consequences
[What becomes easier or more difficult to do and any risks introduced by this change?]

## Alternatives Considered
[What other options were evaluated?]

## Implementation Notes
[Any specific implementation details or requirements]
```

## üîÑ ADR Process

### Creating a New ADR
1. Copy the template above
2. Assign the next sequential number (XXXX)
3. Fill in all sections thoroughly
4. Set status to "Proposed"
5. Create a pull request for review
6. Update status to "Accepted" when approved

### Updating Existing ADRs
- ADRs should rarely be changed after acceptance
- If an ADR needs significant changes, create a new ADR that supersedes it
- Update the old ADR's status to "Superseded by ADR-YYYY"

### ADR Review Process
1. Technical accuracy review by core team
2. Impact assessment on existing systems
3. Implementation feasibility evaluation
4. Alignment with project goals verification

ADRs help maintain architectural consistency and provide context for future decisions. All significant architectural decisions should be documented as ADRs.
