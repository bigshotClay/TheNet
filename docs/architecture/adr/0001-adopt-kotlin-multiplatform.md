# ADR-0001: Adopt Kotlin Multiplatform for Cross-Platform Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
TheNet requires a cross-platform solution to support Android, iOS, and Desktop platforms while maintaining code consistency and developer productivity. The application involves complex logic including P2P networking, blockchain integration, cryptography, and content management that would benefit from code sharing.

Key requirements:
- Native performance on all platforms
- Shared business logic and data models
- Platform-specific UI capabilities
- Access to platform-specific APIs (networking, cryptography, storage)
- Strong type safety and null safety
- Excellent tooling and debugging support
- Future scalability to web platforms

## Decision
We will use Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) as the primary development platform for TheNet, with the following structure:

- **Shared Module**: Common business logic, data models, and platform abstractions
- **Platform Modules**: Platform-specific implementations and UI layers
- **UI Framework**: Compose Multiplatform for shared UI components where possible
- **Native Integration**: Platform-specific code for performance-critical or platform-unique features

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- **Code Reuse**: 60-80% of business logic shared across platforms
- **Consistency**: Single source of truth for core algorithms and data structures
- **Type Safety**: Strong compile-time guarantees across all platforms
- **Developer Productivity**: Single team can develop for all platforms
- **Maintenance**: Bug fixes and feature updates apply to all platforms simultaneously
- **Testing**: Shared tests ensure consistent behavior across platforms
- **Performance**: Native compilation provides optimal performance on each platform

### Negative Consequences
- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn KMP-specific patterns and platform abstractions
- **Tooling Maturity**: KMP tooling, while improving, is less mature than single-platform alternatives
- **Platform Limitations**: Some platform-specific features require careful abstraction design
- **Build Complexity**: Multi-platform builds can be more complex to configure and debug
- **Debugging**: Cross-platform debugging can be more challenging than single-platform debugging

### Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: KMP ecosystem gaps for specialized libraries
  - **Mitigation**: Use expect/actual pattern for platform-specific implementations
- **Risk**: iOS development complexity without native Swift/Objective-C
  - **Mitigation**: Use platform-specific code for iOS-specific features, leverage KMP for business logic only
- **Risk**: Performance concerns for compute-intensive operations
  - **Mitigation**: Profile early and use native implementations for performance-critical paths

## Alternatives Considered

### Flutter
**Pros**: 
- Mature cross-platform UI framework
- Good performance and tooling
- Large community and ecosystem

**Cons**: 
- Dart language less suitable for system-level programming
- Limited access to low-level networking and cryptography APIs
- Less flexibility for P2P networking requirements
- Weaker type system compared to Kotlin

### React Native + TypeScript
**Pros**: 
- Large ecosystem and community
- Good for UI-heavy applications
- Familiar web technologies

**Cons**: 
- JavaScript bridge performance limitations
- Complex native module integration for P2P networking
- Weaker type safety compared to Kotlin
- Not suitable for compute-intensive blockchain operations

### Native Development (Separate Android/iOS/Desktop Apps)
**Pros**: 
- Maximum platform integration
- Best possible performance
- Access to all platform APIs

**Cons**: 
- Significant code duplication (3-4x development effort)
- Consistency challenges across platforms
- Higher maintenance burden
- Team scaling challenges (need platform-specific expertise)

### Xamarin
**Pros**: 
- Mature Microsoft ecosystem
- Good platform integration

**Cons**: 
- Microsoft ecosystem lock-in
- C# less suitable for system programming compared to Kotlin
- Limited desktop support
- Uncertain long-term future

## Implementation Notes

└── [platform modules]/    # Specialized platform modules
```

### Platform Abstraction Strategy
- Use `expect/actual` for platform-specific implementations
- Create interfaces for platform-dependent services
- Implement dependency injection for platform services
- Use sealed classes for platform-specific behavior modeling

### Technology Integration
- **P2P Networking**: IPv8 Kotlin implementation with platform-specific transport layers
- **Blockchain**: Corda integration through shared Kotlin modules
- **Cryptography**: Bouncy Castle (JVM) + LazySodium with platform-specific secure storage
- **UI**: Compose Multiplatform with platform-specific components where needed

### Performance Considerations
- Use Kotlin/Native for compute-intensive operations on iOS
- Leverage coroutines for asynchronous P2P networking
- Implement platform-specific optimizations through expect/actual pattern
- Profile and optimize shared algorithms for each platform's characteristics

### Development Workflow
1. Develop core functionality in shared module with comprehensive tests
2. Create platform abstractions using expect/actual pattern
3. Implement platform-specific code as needed
4. Test on all platforms throughout development
5. Use shared CI/CD pipeline for consistent builds

This decision positions TheNet for efficient cross-platform development while maintaining the flexibility to optimize for each platform's unique characteristics and requirements.
